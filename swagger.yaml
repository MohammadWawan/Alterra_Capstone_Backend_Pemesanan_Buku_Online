      title: The Contemporary Thesaurus of Search Terms and Synonyms
      subtitle: A Guide for Natural Language Computer Searching
      authors:
        - Sara D. Knapp
      publisher: Greenwood Publishing Group
      publishedDate: '2000'
      description: >-
        Whether your search is limited to a single database or is as expansive
        as all of cyberspace, you won't find the intended results unless you use
        the words that work. Now in its second edition, Sara Knapp has updated
        and expanded this invaluable resource. Unlike any other thesaurus
        available, this popular guide offers a wealth of natural language
        options in a convenient, A-to-Z format. It's ideal for helping users
        find the appropriate word or words for computer searches in the
        humanities, social sciences, and business. The second edition has added
        more than 9,000 entries to the first edition's extensive list. Now, the
        Thesaurus contains almost 21,000 search entries! New or expanded areas
        include broader coverage of business terms and humanities-including arts
        literature, philosophy, religion, and music.

      description: >-
        College sophomore Tyler Gallagher loves computers, video games, and
        Thanksgiving Break. He's timed the arrival of his computer components
        with the holiday vacation from school to blast aliens and enemy soldiers
        alike on his brand new, high-end gaming computer. When the parts arrive,
        it soon becomes apparent that they aren't what he ordered from
        TechTerritory. Thinking he's the butt of a practical joke, Tyler plays
        along, and builds the computer with the obviously fake components. His
        annoyance turns to shock when the computer powers on. His shock turns to
        a mix of disbelief and wonder when he learns the strange "quantum"
        computer can pull web pages from the near future. Disbelief and wonder
        soon become fear and uncertainty when he discovers the future might not
        be so bright. "Search Terms: Alpha" is the first half of a new time
        travel thriller. 52,000 word novel Adult themes / language / mild sexual

      title: Sight Words Word Search Book for Kids
      subtitle: High Frequency Words Activity Book for Raising Confident Readers
      authors:
        - Sparkling Minds
      publishedDate: '2020-02-12'
      description: >-
        Support your kids in becoming confident readers by helping them master
        high frequency words! Sight words are words that occur frequently enough
        in written language that a child should recognize them automatically on
        sight. Another characteristic that makes many sight words special is
        that they don't follow the rules of phonics. For these reasons,
        mastering sight words is of great importance for boosting your child's
        reading confidence and future success. Word search puzzles provide a
        powerful tool to review and reinforce high frequency words. The process
        of search and recognition of letters and words allows children to build
        their literacy skills in a fun and easy way. Lowercase letters. Since
        most of the words children encounter in reading materials are made up of
        lowercase letters, literacy experts recommend teaching sight words using
        lowercase. 50 word search puzzles with over 170 Dolch sight words for
        preschool, kindergarten, first grade and second grade. Word placement
        (horizontal and vertical, no diagonal or backwards) facilitates the
        learning process. Answers can be found at the back of the book. Let your
        children have fun while building their reading confidence!
